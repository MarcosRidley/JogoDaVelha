Gameboard is supposed to be an array inside the gameboard object
Each player should also be an object, each with a value (X and O) and pertinent methods
The game flow itself (which players turn it is, which cells are filled and who wins)
should also be an object.
Each cell (a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, b3, c1, c2, c3) is an item on the gameboard array inside the gameboard object

1) set up HTML and CSS
    1.1) html: body>main>section(button + paragraph  ) + section(gameboard)> 9 divs on a 3x3 grid (0 gap,
css borders will make for perfect # gameboard) 
2) set up css - center startGame button+Paragraph and gameboard sections with flexbox.
    2.1) use borders on the 9 divs to create a # pattern. Divs should all have the same size with easy-to-read text for "X" and "O"
    2.2) 1: down-right, 2: sides-down, 3: down-left, 4: all but left, 5: all 6: all but right 7: up-right 8: all but down 9: up-left.
3) add functionality to gameboard
    3.1) each div should have an event listener tied to it so that once it's clicked it is marked by the current player
    3.2) once a div has been claimed by a player the other player cannot claim it.  
    3.3) a claimed div has either an X or an O depending on the claiming player 
    3.4) check for all possible combinations that could result in a win
        3.4.1) for a square on the following orientation:
        123
        456
        789
        the winning combinations would be 123, 147, 258, 369, 456, 789, 159 and 357. 
        4.4.2) options: set up ifs on every claim verifying who claims these locations and return winningPlayer 
        if one of these combinations is found, else check if every div has been filled and if yes then return draw
    
    //
4) add functionality to reset button
    4.1) on click it should wipe the board and all stored values.
5) add functionality to playerTurnTracker paragraph (X or O player's turn indicator).
6) add footer and release 1.0;
7) add inteligence(minimax algorithm?)
